## Getting Started

Welcome to my "League of Legends" personal project! This project will be in Java only. I'm currently taking CS-200 at my university and would like to practice what I learn inside and outside of the classroom on my own.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain the .java files
- `bin`: the folder to for the Java .class files

## Output & Terminal Usage
As of right now, the beginning of the program will prompt windows on the user's computer screen. After that has occured, the user will be directed to use the 'Terminal' to continue.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Thank You, I hope you enjoy!
Thank you for viewing my project and taking the time to look it over. I'm open to any contributions and how my code can be fixed/improved. I will be working on this project throughout my semester while taking CS-200; I will make sure to add improvements or additional components to the project every day. Regards -> Zo (Lorenzo) Walters
